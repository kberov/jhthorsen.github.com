<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>
  The idea was a system which could monitor and provision a variety of network equipment.
  The primary target was cable modems and CMTS, but to do that the project had to contain
  more functionality
</p>

<h3>A DHCP server</h3>
<p>
  The cable modem and customer computer equipment need IP addresses. I decided to use
  <a href="http://www.isc.org/software/dhcp">ISC DHCPd</a> for this purpose, because
  it can dynamically serve config files based on MAC address (option 82).
  In addition, it's a very stable and capable DHCP server for all other equipment,
  beside cable modems.
</p>

<h3>A TFTP server</h3>
<p>
  After a cable modem has received a response from the DHCP server, it will try to
  download a config file from a TFTP server. I decided to write this TFTP server in
  pure perl, because I could then build the config files dynamically from profiles
  stored in a backend. The profiles would be split into different segments, which
  mostly should default to a "most common" profile and then the bandwidth profile
  would be applied on top of that.
</p>
<p>
  I started out with <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Net::TFTPd">Net::TFTPd</a>
  but realized that it was not easy to hook into and it wasn't all that effective.
  I then decided to write my own implementation called <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/POE::Component::TFTPd">POE::Component::TFTPd</a>,
  which I was quite pleased with. Even so it tried to make it even faster, which
  resulted in <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/AnyEvent::TFTPd">AnyEvent::TFTPd</a>,
  but the module was shut down by the project owner of AnyEvent. If I was continuing
  the development, I would probably write a Mojo::IOLoop based version instead, since
  Mojolicious is a fantastic framework.
</p>

<h3>A collector daemon</h3>
<p>
  I wanted the system to be plug and play, so the collector daemon would start out
  by probing the computers in the same network, checking if they could respond
  on SNMP requests. If they could they would automatically be added to the Quelea
  frontend, where the credentials (if any) would have to be added before the
  collector again started getting information from the various equipment. The
  collector would in the first place be "limited" to only supporting SNMP.
</p>
<p>
  The most important data (imo) to collect would be:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    CMTS
    <ul>
      <li>Tx on downstream</li>
      <li>SNR on upstream</li>
      <li>Maybe cable modem signals.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Cable modem
    <ul>
      <li>Tx on upstream</li>
      <li>SNR on downstream</li>
      <li>Rx on downstream</li>
      <li>Micro reflections on downstream</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
