[YAPC::Europe::2007](http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007) was a blast! I
can't really put my finger on what was the best, because it was all good.
I really recommend every Perl-programmer out there to come to next years
YAPC in Denmark/Copenhagen.I had a talk this year as well (Operator
overloading, one of the magicks of Perl), but I wasn't any happy about it.
Even so, I got some positive feedback, which I don't really understand.
I will try again next year, if they accept me. I might have to trick them
into accepting me, since it's a bit off topic, but I'll wait and see...
