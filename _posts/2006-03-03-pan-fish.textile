He told us that there's no guaranty in the stock marked, and it turned out he was right - but now it has rized again, from something like <a href="http://www.google.no/search?q=0.01%20nok%20in%20euros&amp;hl=no&amp;">0.01 NOK</a> pr share, to <acronym title="Approximately the same as gave...">4.38</acronym>, so it's rather exciting now ;) <br>(The Image is from <a href="http://hegnar.no">hegnar.no</a>)
