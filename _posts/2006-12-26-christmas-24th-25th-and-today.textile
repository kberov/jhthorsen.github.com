title: Christmas - 24th, 25th and today
---

<acronym title="That is, if you celebrate x-mas">Merry Christmas</acronym> to you, known and unknown guests. My holiday has so far been pretty enjoyable: <acronym title="24th">Christmas eve</acronym> was kind of strange this year, since it was only me and my parents. Both my sister and brother celebrated with their repspectable's family. The three of us still made a nice evening. My mother cooked a fantastic dinner. Then later we had a tasty desert and a pile of presents to open. Myself got a lot of useful gifts, suitable for my new apartment, plus a scarf and tie from my <acronym title="GirlFriend">gf</acronym>. I was especially happy about the tie and scarf, since they suited my taste, and I therefor didn't have lie when I said "Thank you" :)
 Yesterday I cought a flue. I was feeling pretty lousy, but I still manage to participate in a family dinner + a gathering at a friends place. Both events was quite enjoyable, and my flue kind of disappeared after a couple of "gin & tonics". I'm still feeling a bit crappy today, but I really want to go to another party later this evening, so I better pull myself together...
