My body screams "Help!"...
 Some of my friends "tricked" me out of my apartment today. We went out at sea where we drove around in my friend's boat and got <i>some</i> sun at our bodies. Apparently it was a bit too much, since I'm allready feeling the heat and pain from my skin (4:45pm). I put on some sunscreen (factor 6), but it was from last year...
 Remember kids: <b>Don't use sunscreen from last year!</b> So what have I learned today? Well about the same thing I learned last year and year before that: <b>Remember proper lotion when sunbathing :P</b> I still think the day was worth the pain, since I enjoy being at the sea with good friends.
