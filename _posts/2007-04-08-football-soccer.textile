title: Football (Soccer)

I've joined <a href="http://ubrfc.org">UBR&nbsp;FC</a>, a football team in Grimstad. We just teamed up about a month ago, but we're allready commited to a local league, and we're thinking about playing in the norwegian cup later this fall.  I'm not sure if we're fit enough for the task, but it's great fun to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer">soccer</a> anyway, and I'm looking forward to the matches either way it's outcome will be.
