title: SNMP::Effective
---

I'm done writing the code for SNMP::Effective now. It has show to be quite promising after some<a href="http://home.flodhest.net/perl/SNMP_Effective.txt?embed=true">tests</a>: 4000 hosts in 50 seconds is quite better than what I had with a <acronym title="1.8 hosts pr second">previous module</acronym>. I'm hoping to release SNMP::Effective on <a href="http://cpan.org">CPAN</a>, later this year. But first I need to complete <a href="http://eidolon.flodhest.net/eAdmin">eAdmin 2.0</a>. In the meanwhile, you could try <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~tpg/SNMP-Multi/">SNMP::Multi</a>, which gave me the idea to write my own.
