title: New subdomains added
---

I've forgot to enounce this earlier, but I've added two more subdomains to flodhest.net:
 
     * <a href="http://paste.flodhest.net">paste.flodhest.net</a> is a html-pastebin. It features "preview" and w3c-checking. Enjoy!
     * <a href="http://trac.flodhest.net">trac.flodhest.net</a> is a web-based management system for my projects. There's not much there yet, but I've added <a href="http://trac.flodhest.net/eadmin">eAdmin</a>.
 
 I'm going to add perl-modules and other stuff as well, but that's for the future - hopefully not a distant future.
