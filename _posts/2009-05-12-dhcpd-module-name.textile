title: Which name to pick?
---

I'm writing a new "module":http://github.com/jhthorsen/net-dhcpd/tree, which is currently named "Net::DHCPd". It's not a good name imo, since Net::DHCPd sounds more like a module that actually _is_ a dhcp server, which mine is not.

This is what it can, or is supposed to support in the future:

* Interact with ISC DHCPd
* Start/stop/restart the daemon
* Parse and build config
* Check config file for error
* Parse leases file

So what should it be called? I'm thinking about naming it ISC::DHCPd, since it's primary target is to interact with that spesific server. But can I call it the same as what "the actual server":https://www.isc.org/software/dhcp is called?

Let me know if you have any idea.
