[I've managed to get](http://home.flodhest.net/gallery/screenshot/xgl-1.png?embed=true)
[Xgl](http://en.opensuse.org/Xgl) to work! (Special thanks to
[DavidK-64](http://www.ritter.demon.co.uk) for A: telling me about Xgl
B: helping me get through the basic [install-steps](http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_XGL)
It's really amazing, you just got to [see](http://www.freedesktop.org/~davidr/xgl-demo1.xvid.avi)
for yourself to get the real impression. The [compiz](http://en.opensuse.org/Compiz)
manager features Wobbling windows, transparancy, a new "switcher" and a whole
lot more. I'm truly speachless. This is the best eye-candy I've ever
experienced. Even though I'm no fan of windows, It will be interresting to
see how [Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/default.aspx)'s 3D
effects will be, compared to Xgl+compiz... The basic install-steps are really
quite basic - at least in ubuntu with nvidia: 
 
1. Install Xgl and compiz* packages
2. Start [Xgl](http://home.flodhest.net/linux/xgl/Xgl_start.txt?embed=true)
   and <acronym title="Or whatever X-based terminal you like">xterm</acronym>
3. su - &#60;username>
4. Start [compiz + gnome](http://home.flodhest.net/linux/xgl/compiz_gnome.txt?embed=true)
5. Run gconf-editor and configure the [plugins](http://home.flodhest.net/linux/xgl/gconf.png?embed=true)
