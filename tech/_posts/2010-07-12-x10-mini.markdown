title: Xperia X10 mini
---

So I've been using my [X10 mini](http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/corporate/products/phoneportfolio/specification/xperiax10mini)
for ten days now, and it has been quite a bumpy ride:

Last weekend I had to charge it about every six/eight hour. I have to admit that I
did use it a lot in the beginning, but i was still shocked to see how bad the battery
was: I mean a mobile phone which requires a cord isn't really mobile :S

After I got back from my weekend I decided to change back to my [Nokia 5800](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_5800_XpressMusic),
just to have a phone I could use over night without charging it. At the same time I
also sent an email to [CDON](http://cdon.com) telling them that I wanted to return the
phone. (yeah, I know it's a bit strange to bue a phone from cdon...) CDON was really
nice and explained to me (without question) how I could return the phone. Even though
I had given up on the battery, I really thought the phone was excellent, so the next
day I decided to start reading [reviews and blogs](http://www.google.com/search?q=x10+mini+battery+life)
to figure out if there where anything I could do to extend the battery life. I also
asked a co-worker who gave me some information I found hard to believe....

Even so, after a day of reading and charging the phone, I figured out that it wasn't
all that crappy as expected and I've now managed to get the lifespan from eight hours
to more than two days! So this is what I did:

* Co-worker + blogs stated that the battery actually gets better over time! I have no
  idea what kind of crazy chemical reaction is involved, but it must be true: Swapping
  software just can't make such an improvement by it self (?)
* "Supercharged it". Meaning I charged it to full and then simply kept on charging it.
  I pulled to cord out a couple of times, but plugged it in again when I saw that the
  battery indicator dropped instantly.
* Replaced whatever SE got pre-installed with "[helix](http://helixproject.ruqqq.sg/download.php?id=19)"
  launcher.
* Installed "Advanced task killer" and killed a lot of SE background processes I didn't
  need anyway. ATK also periodically kills background processes which is just idling.
* Installed "BatteryTime". Doesn't do much for the battery time, but simply more
  detailed information about how much battery/time is left to use for various tasks.
* I got bluetooth, GPS and wireless turned off most of the time. I know this kind of
  sucks, but since I hardly ever use bluetooth, nor wireless anyway it's not so bad.
  I will try to use GPS more, just to see how it impacts the battery, but for now I
  got it turned off and use AGPS instead.

The crappy thing about the bullets above is that I did it all at once, so I cannot
really tell which one worked, but at least doing them all works for me and I'm now
quite happy with the phone! Of course having a smart phone, battery lasting for
days, big screen, small form factor.... It's just not possible these days for me to
achieve the ultimate phone, so I need to settle for something.

## Other useful/cool applications

* [Bump](http://bu.mp/) - Share data (pictures, apps, contacts++) by bumping two phones
  with "bump" installed
* [ConnectBot](http://code.google.com/p/connectbot) - SSH client. Pretty useless on x10,
  since of the screen size, but still a nice SSH client.
* [Goggles](http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles) - "Use pictures to search the web"
* [Google Sky Map](http://www.google.com/sky/skymap/ ) - Move your phone around to see
  how the universe looks from your perspective.
* [GPS status](http://www.google.com/search?q=gps+status+android) - Digital compass and
  speedometer.
* [Opera mini 5 beta](http://www.opera.com/mobile/) - I would like to replace the
  "internal browser" with Opera, but I still don't know how. (TODO)
* [Startup manager](http://www.google.com/search?q=startup+manager+android) - Make sure
  not too many useless processes start when the phone boots.
* [SyncMyPix](http://www.google.com/search?q=syncmypix+android) - Sync between facebook
  and address book.

## Todo

Root the phone. Replace the rest of the crap with Android 2.x.
