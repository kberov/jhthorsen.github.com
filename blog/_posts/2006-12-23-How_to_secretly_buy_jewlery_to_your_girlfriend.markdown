title: How to secretly buy jewlery to your girlfriend
---

This might be a late "mini-howto", but I'm still posting it.
 
1. Tell your girlfriend that you have allready bought her a gift.
2. Ask her what she likes, while going through various jewlery shops.
3. Tell her that you're collecting ideas for another occasion.
4. A couple of days later, tell your gf that you have to buy some bread.
   (or make up some other excause)
5. When going to the groceries, stop by the jewlery shop and by what ever
   she wanted.
6. DO NOT FORGET TO BUY BREAD!
7. Hide the present for later.

Extra tip is to hide the gift in different bag, than the one they gave you in
the jewlery shop.

PS: This mini-howto can also be applied for other gifts :)
