title: Broken leg
---

I [broke my leg](http://home.flodhest.net/gallery/2006-11.feb%20oslo/)
while sledging down "[korketrekkeren](http://www.oslosurf.com/innhold/00000165.shtml)"
in Oslo. It happened while I sat behind a friend on a
[snow racer](http://images.google.no/images?q=snow%20racer&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi)
and tried to brake with my foot. The foot got hooked in something and was
turned into an "incorrect position"... The leg had to be plastered, so
I'll be stuck inside for several weeks (six to be accurate). This incident
changes my plans as well: I were supposed to celebrate my own, my
[brother](http://thishomepage.does.it) and his fiancee's birthday, but these
events are all located in this timespan. - Thanks a million
