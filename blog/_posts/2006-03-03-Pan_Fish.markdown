stocks are finally going up again :) A friend of mine "tricked" me and a
third guy into buing the stocks a couple of years ago. He told us that
there's no guaranty in the stock marked, and it turned out he was right - but
now it has rized again, from something like [0.01 NOK](http://www.google.no/search?q=0.01%20nok%20in%20euros&amp;hl=no&amp;)
pr share.
