title: New apartment
---

I've finally escaped the old apartment! I guess the old apartment is news
to some of my readers, so I'll give a short resume: I've been living for
four years <acronym title="In a basement">below ground</acronym>, with some
friends. We've had quite a few good times, but living together for that
many years does something to you: You kind of grow tired of other people
habits, but you also grow into other people habits. I think moving around is
healthy from time to time. I earlier this fall figured out it was about time
to find a new place, but I didn't really have too much time to find one.

I really felt the need for my own space, after getting a girlfriend. We
started reading ads, but the breakthrough came after adding our own ad in
the [local newspaper](http://www.adressetidende.no/): <i>"Couple seeks
apartment for rent. Central location. Good references. Rate between 4k and
6k."</i> There were quite a few who called me, but there were only some
that was interresting. The apartment I finally decided to rent is a bit
expensive (for me), but it's also really nice: There is about 12 feet
between floor and ceiling in the bedroom and livingroom. A
[rosette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosette_%28design%29) is located in
the center of the ceiling, where the lights hang from. I have an spare
bedroom, a bathroom and a kitchen. Total base is around 800 sq. feet.
