title: The day after...
---

The time is 1:45 PM, I've been up for an hour now, and I feel like crap. The only thing that'll get me through this day, is a Quarter pounder at [Apotekergaarden](http://apotekergaarden.no)</a>, one of the best restaurants in southern Norway. The food was of course excellent, and the service aswell. Afterwards we had some drinks, beer, and whatever we came across :P Summed up; I had a great time, and my foot didn't suffer from any further damage.
