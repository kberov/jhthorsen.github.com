title: A little note about my psyche
---

I'm quite interrested in what people think about themselves. I don't care
that much about what you've done, what you're doing, or what you're going
to do. What interests me is to know how people think about stuff and
themselves. Asking "what have you been up to?", usually end after a
couple of minutes with a relatively boring resyme. While asking
"how are you?" - and getting an honest answer can be much more interresting.
