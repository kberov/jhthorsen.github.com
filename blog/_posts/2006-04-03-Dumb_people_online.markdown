title: Dumb people online
---

Security online can be increased by adding digital certificates. These
certificates provides encryption, which makes the data submitted/retrived
to/from the server unable to be read by sniffers which may be located on
the path of information. I agree on the fact that these digital certificates
are a nescessity, but still there are so many dumb and/or ignorant users
online, that I would like to see another certificate as well: Why not set a
minimal requirement for users to be able to use the net? A simple course
where a final exam would grant or deny the participant access to the
internet would decrease the number of ignorant users online, which again
could save alot of money and time! My head starts spinning every time I get
a client calling, asking all kinds of dumb questions. No questions are dumb
you say? -- Well, I can agree to some degree, but when the client is unable
to respond to the simplest counter-questions... Arg!

I will update this blog, when my head stops spinning :/
