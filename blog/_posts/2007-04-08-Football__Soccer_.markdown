I've joined [UBR&nbsp;FC](http://ubrfc.org)</a>, a football team in
Grimstad. We just teamed up about a month ago, but we're allready commited
to a local league, and we're thinking about playing in the norwegian cup
later this fall.  I'm not sure if we're fit enough for the task, but it's
great fun to play [soccer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer) anyway,
and I'm looking forward to the matches either way it's outcome will be.
