title: My leg...
---

I removed the plaster from my leg yesterday. I was at the hospital where
the doctor asked me if I had used my leg the last few weeks. I answered
that I was told <i>not</i> to use it, but he could inform me that it's
smart to start using the foot the last weeks, before removing the plaster!
Why wasn't I told earlier...? I now have to fit and stretch my leg, but
it might take a while, since my foot is kind of stuck now, and most common
movements hurts like hell. Anyway; the plaster is off, and I'm in
"recovery mode". (Wish me luck)
