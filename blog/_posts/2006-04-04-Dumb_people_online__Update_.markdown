title: Dumb people online (Update)
---

I've gotton some negative response to the blog "Dumb people online".
Let me answer: I'm not really trying to express that I am better than
anyone else. Believe me; I've made some boo-boo's in my life as well.
But what I want to say that if you feel targeted by the "Dumb people
online", you might just want to try to learn some more.

Here is some examples on what I would like you to know:

* [Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) is not the same as
  Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer is simply a tool to browse / explore
  the internet - And let me say: a rather [poor tool](http://alistapart.com/articles/tohell/).
  Please be aware that there exist [other browsers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser).
* Try to learn how to use a computer, before trying to go online. If you
  don't know how to turn the computer on/off, then you're probably gonna
  be a security risk for yourself and million of others.
* Learn about [phising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phising), but don't
  get scared - get aware. Phising is when you see something that looks
  "real", but it's really just a good duplicate created to fool you. It can
  ask for personal information, money or something else that has value...
  K&#95;F has written [RSA dilutes phishing hauls to fight fraud](http://www.kfwebs.net/news/502/RSA-dilutes-phishing-hauls-to-fight-fraud)
  which kind of says the same as me, but maybe in a more gentle way (?)
* Are you tired of waiting on the phone, because you cannot get online, or
  your email doesn't work? Next time someone helps you, try pick up some tips
  and tricks. Like try to see how everything is plugged together, and which
  lights should be lit on the equipment. There might even be a handbook,
  that could tell you about the most common mistakes. This could actually
  save you from a lot of trouble.
