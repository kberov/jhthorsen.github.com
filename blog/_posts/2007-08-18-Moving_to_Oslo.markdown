title: Moving to Oslo
---

Today I moved to Oslo. I still don't have any apartment, so I'm staying at a
friends place for now. Hopefully, I'll find an apartment soon, but I don't
think it'll be easy, because there's a lot of students trying to get a place
to live as well. Anyway, I'm really looking forward to this: New location,
new job, new opportunities.
