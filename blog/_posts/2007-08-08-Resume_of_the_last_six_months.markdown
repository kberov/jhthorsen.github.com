title: Resume of the last six months
---

I was on a business trip to [Wuhan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan),
in China. I almost didn't make it, because I was sick the week upfront,
but on the last day I drank a lot [Fernet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernet),
which really kicked some sickness ass, so off I went - destination China.

I was in China for twelve days. During those days I had a lot of exiting
experiences and great fun: I tasted a lot of new food that the people from the
company ordered to me. Almost everything tasted good, but there where some
exceptions: Like the foot of a chicken and stomach of a cow. Another thing
that was totally different was the way to drive: They didn't seem to be any
specific rules, but I was never afraid and the traffic went surprisingly
smooth.

I did and saw a lot more than this, but it just won't fit in this
"blog-resume"... It was a bit strange to leave China and my new friends after
the twelve day long stay, but it was also good to get back home.

I've started using [facebook](http://facebook.com). I haven't really been
the most active user, and after getting to know the [terms](http://www.facebook.com/terms.php),
I've become a bit of a skeptic: Facebook owns you body and soul - or at
least everything you add to your facebook. I still think it's nice to have
a placeholder for old and new friends.

Sometime in May, I got a new job-offer. It wasn't a direct offer, so I needed
to attend some job-interviews, but after telling about myself and what I can,
I got myself a new job at [Linpro](http://linpro.no). I'm really looking
forward to the new job, that starts the 20th of August. I also went to an
interview at [Opera](http://opera.com), but they were not interested. It
didn't really matter to me, since I was already keen about the job at Linpro.
Linpro is in Oslo, so I need to get an apartment. I still haven't got one,
but it doesn't stress me, since I have some backup plans...

I broken up with my girlfriend in June, so you can call me "Jan Solo" now:P
It was kind of ugly, but I think it was for the best, even though some might
disagree.

The rest of the summer, I've been working at [Eidolon](http://eidolon.as),
trying to tide up any loose ends. It have been a lot of work, but it's nice
to know that I don't leave things half-done. Next week I'll have a well earned
vacation, before starting in my new job. It will be nice.
