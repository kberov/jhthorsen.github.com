<h2>Iron man</h2>
<p>From <a href="http://www.enlightenedperl.org/ironman.html">http://www.enlightenedperl.org/ironman.html</a>:</p>
<blockquote>In order to promote the Perl language, and encourage more people within the Perl community to promote the language to the world outside the Perl echo-chamber, Enlightened Perl is pleased to announce the Iron Man Perl Blogging Challenge.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The rules are very simple: you blog, about Perl. Any aspect of Perl you like. Long, short, funny, serious, advanced, basic: it doesn't matter. It doesn't have to be in English, either, if that's not your native language. To stay in the Iron Man Challenge, you must maintain a rolling frequency of 4 posts every 32 days, with no more than 10 days between posts.</blockquote>
